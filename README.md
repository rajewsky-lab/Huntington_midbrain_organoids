# Huntington_midbrain_organoids
Code related to single cell transcriptomic analyses in the manuscript 'Mutant Huntingtin impairs neurodevelopment in human brain organoids through CHCHD2-mediated neurometabolic failure'.

You can run the notebook using the data files from the related GEO repository starting from the digital gene expression matrices generated by Cell Ranger or directly from the pre-processed Seurat objects (recommended). In the latter case, please ignore the code before the import of the pre-processed object with the readRDS function.
